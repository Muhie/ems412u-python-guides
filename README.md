# Motivation

In response to student feedback from previous runs of the module, Dr. Rehan Shah, in conjunction with three former students (Mr. Muhie Sultan Faisal Al Haimus, Mr. Yash Vaghela, and Mr. Ilanthiraiyan Sivagnanamoorthy) of this course, have co-created a **Python Common Errors and Practice Questions toolkit guide** to help new incoming first-year students who may need additional guidance and support with Python, particularly those with no previous programming experience. 

## Python Common Errors Toolkit

The **Common Errors toolkit** serves as a supplementary resource for you to use alongside the Python tutorials on Jupyterhub. It documents the standard errors that students most often make, along with ways to rectify them.

## Python Practice Questions Toolkit

The **Practice Questions toolkit** is meant to serve as an additional list of practice Python exercises covering content from Weeks 1-6. After you have completed the IT class tutorials on Jupyterhub, you may wish to try these exercises to hone your programming skills.

## Video Installation Resources

These are interactive installation guides tailored to installing the dependencies for the EMS412U module. Which can be found ![here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRj58RCRRSE&list=PLVTKec-v1Xhsq0B_q3NbLEAafPlh_3XhE)
